# Open-Windows-Closer-WIN-X86-
This is a small application that simply goes through each open window and asks 
if you'd like to close it. This is a much faster alternative than opening task 
manager, or going one by one to close them :). Do note though, that this doesn't
efficiently at all close your programs, and this is basically like going to task
manager and force closing your programs, so use at your own risk and be careful.

## A Quick Note
Since This application relies heavily on system calls, it may be
the case that certain versions of windows do not work with this application, as
well as processors apart from an Intel x86. 

## How to use
Just compile the .cpp file with whatever compiler you'd like and
run the executable. Stay tuned for a GUI in the future!
